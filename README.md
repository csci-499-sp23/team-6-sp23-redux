EasyHangOut is a web application designed to make finding recreational spots to hang out with friends simple and intuitive. The app operates in a similar fashion to Tinder, presenting users with a series of recreational locations that they can choose to save for later by swiping right or dismiss by swiping left. EasyHangOut leverages the power of JavaScript, React and Yelp API to find recreational places across New York. The app is designed with a focus on young adults who want to find great places to hang out with friends without having to go through the exhaustive online research process.
